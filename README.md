->CSS is cascading style sheets <br/>
->It is used to handle the presentation of the website (makes it presentable)containing HTML.<br/>
->It gives style to raw HTML i.e to our web pages and make the websites responsive(convienient on both the laptop and phone)<br/>
->On one side HTML is used to structure a website wheras CSS is responsible for the design.<br/>
->There are basically three ways to add css in markup(HTML CODE):<br/>
*Inline css: CSS is added to elements directly using style attribute.<br/>
*Internal css: CSS is kept inside the head tags in <style> tags.<br/>
*External css : CSS is kept separately inside a .css style sheet.(Preferred)
 ->Selectors :CSS selectors are used to find the element whose property will be set and are used to target the HTML elements(single/Multiple).<br/>
->There are basically four types of selectors: CSS element Selector	,CSS id selector, CSS class and css grouping selector.</br>
->The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:</br>
->Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear</br>
->Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</br>
->Border - A border that goes around the padding and content</br>
->Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</br>
