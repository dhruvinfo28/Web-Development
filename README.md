->CSS is cascading style sheets <br/>
->It is used to handle the presentation of the website (makes it presentable)containing HTML.<br/>
->It gives style to raw HTML i.e to our web pages and make the websites responsive(convienient on both the laptop and phone)<br/>
->On one side HTML is used to structure a website wheras CSS is responsible for the design.<br/>
->There are basically three ways to add css in markup(HTML CODE):<br/>
*Inline css: CSS is added to elements directly using style attribute.<br/>
*Internal css: CSS is kept inside the head tags in <style> tags.<br/>
*External css : CSS is kept separately inside a .css style sheet.(Preferred)
